					You've got to show off your product somehow.
					Otherwise, why would people have a reason to pick your product over someone else's?
					However, the commercials for these products have deceptive tactics like <b>stretching the truth</b> or even <b>straight up lying</b>.
				</p>
				<p class="left">
					You might be one to think that people could never fall for something so obvious as a blatant lie, but it might happen more often than you think.
					<b>It could even be happening to you!</b>
				</p>
				<p class="right">
					Did you find any interest in the <b>Fushigi Magic Gravity Ball</b>?
					If so, maybe you're excited to try it out and impress your friends with it's gravity-defying abilities,
					or maybe you want to relieve yourself with its therapeutic powers.
					Well, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that might not be the case for you.
					In fact, it might not be the case for most people, because <b>the ball does not defy gravity nor have any therapeutic capabilities</b> as they claim it does.
					There's actually nothing magical about it at all; it's just a neat-looking ball.
					All of the cool tricks that you see the people performing are simply the result of their skills and not the ball itself.
					<b>The ball can do nothing on its own.</b>
				</p>
				<p class="left">
					Okay, maybe the ball can't float in mid-air, but you can still learn to perform these trick yourself, right?
					Sure! ...but it's not as easy as it looks.
					The art of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_juggling">contact juggling</a> is a skill that takes a lot of practice.
					Do you know how they say you can learn it in just minutes?
					Well, as they say that, the tiny text at the bottom of the screen reads "Experienced Fushigi performers. Proficiency in the art of contact juggling or FUSHIGI takes practice."
					Okay, maybe it's not so easy after all.
					If you already know that this takes practice or you are seeking the challenge of mastering the ball, then maybe this ball or art form is for you.
					The sad truth is that <b>many people buy this thinking it is easy and end up being nothing but disappointed and twenty dollars fewer</b> (and that's not including the extra fees).
				</p>
				<p class="right">
					Maybe you took a liking to the <b>Tracy Jordan Meat Machine</b>?
					If you did, then I'm sorry to tell you it's not actually a real thing (if you couldn't tell already).
					However, it does showcase some of the tactics people use to persuade their audience.
					One of those tactics is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_branding">celebrity endorsement</a>.
					Do you know of Tracy Morgan?
					Maybe, you think he is funny, or maybe you don't know him all that well but you know he is a celebrity.
					<b>If you see someone popular or someone you look up to endorsing a product, then you might be more likely to buy it yourself.</b>
					Even if Tracy Morgan has no background in food or "meat machines", it's easy to like something simply because a celebrity likes it.
				</p>
				<p class="left">
					Another tactic showcased in the commercial is the use of trusted people such as doctors.
					<b>Who would you trust more to give you good health advice: a doctor or a grocery store cashier?</b>
					Hopefully, everyone would have more trust in the doctor given that they have the experience and the credibility to give you such information.
					Likewise, you might be inclined to trust the doctor featured in this commercial.
					Even if the commercial had nothing to do with health, you might trust a doctor because doctors are considered to be smart people.
					If you don't have as much knowledge on the situation like a doctor might, then <b>you might just take what he or she says to be true, even if it isn't.</b>
					What if a doctor says that bread is bad and that you should buy this meat machine and start eating more meat?
					Well, you might just listen to him or her without thinking twice.
				</p>
				<p class="right">
					How about <b>Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size</b> or <b>NIVEA My Silhouette! Redefining Gel-Cream</b>?
					Regardless of if you like either of these two for any reason, both commercials tell information in a way that sounds true but is actually not.
					Eating Frosted Mini-Wheats can increase attentiveness by 20%?
					Wow, that's amazing! ...or is it?
					If you care to read the fine text at the bottom, you might notice that <b>it isn't claiming 20% more attentiveness than from eating other cereals or breakfast foods.
					It's comparing it to eating <i>nothing at all</i></b>.
					Yeah, I think I might be more attentive if I wasn't on an empty stomach.
				</p>
				<p class="left">
					Or maybe you wanted some NIVEA Gel-Cream to help you fit back into your favorite jeans or regain the attention of your significant other.
					<b>Unfortunately for you, that gel-cream might not do a whole lot for you</b> (unless your significant other really likes that gel-cream).
					Actually, it might not make you slimmer at all. Seriously.
					Many people have found out that there doesn't seem to be any noticable difference at all
					(<a href="https://www.influenster.com/reviews/nivea-my-silhouette-redefining-gel-cream-for-the-body/9273556">1</a>,

					After tricking thousands of people with their product, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/06/ftc-settlement-prohibits-marketer-claiming-nivea-skin-cream-can">the FTC held them accountable and fined them a whopping $900,000</a>.
					Ouch.
					As you can see, <b>some commercials will go out of their way to lie in order to get your hard-earned money.</b>
				</p>
				<p class="right">
					Maybe you can at least find some comfort in the <b>EZ Butter</b> cutter, also known as the <i>Butter Express</i> and the <i>Butter Cutter</i>.
					You might be shocked to find out that it actually works as advertised.
					Well, what's the problem with it then?
					If you chose to buy this item, you may or may not have noticed that you paid a lot more than what it is listed as.
					<b>If you thought you were paying $10.00 for an EZ Butter cutter and receiving a second one for free in the process, you'd be wrong.
					The actual amount you are paying is $22.90</b>.
					That's more than double!
					Thanks to those pesky processing and handling fees, <b>you might get caught having to pay more than you thought</b>.
					This is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch">bait-and-switch</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique">foot-in-the-door technique</a>; you think you are paying one price only to find out that you are paying more.
					Well, at least you got the butter cutters you wanted, since cutting butter was so much of a hassle before.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: center">
					These are only five of the millions of commercials out there, but similar strategies can be seen in many others.
					Likewise, these are only a few of the strategies;
					it is important to know when you are being told the truth and when you are being lied to and manipulated for your money.
					If you're ever not sure if something can be trusted or not, take a look at reviews and do some research (even only a little) on who is giving you the information and what they stand for.
					If you can avoid having your money stolen by these commercials, you can have more money to buy better, trustworthy alternatives.
